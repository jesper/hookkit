==========================

Source code may be found on Github:

The latest release may be found by checking out a specific tag:

To contribute, `fork <https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo>`_ and send a `Pull Request <https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests>`_.

The Pull Request should reference a Issue ID or provide a sufficient amount of background information/explanation in the message.

Code should conform to `PEP8 <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_. Running the pep8 and pyflakes commands against your code before sending a pull request will generally save everyone some time - so please do it!

Finally, if possible, a test should be included with each contribution.
